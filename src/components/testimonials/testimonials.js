                        Triston demonstrated keen focus in his work, strong independent streak, 
                        with minimal supervision required to complete this task. 
                        He also possesses good articulation by being able to explain his thoughts and rational behind his work clearly 
                        and convincingly during the demo.

                        I am convinced that with Tristonâ€™s leadership skills and positive learning attitude, he will be an
                        asset to any future projects invaluable.
